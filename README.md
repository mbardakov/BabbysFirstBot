# BabbysFirstBot

A simple Discord bot to experiment with features in the API.

To add to your channel, you need to create your own config/settings.json file, that looks like this:
```
{
    "token":"..."
}
```
with your own token replacing `...`

To run, from the command line:

```
npm install
node built/bot.js
```
